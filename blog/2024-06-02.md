### Compiling the OpenXR header and loader

The OpenXR header and loader have to be compiled manually from source. The source can be downloaded from from [GitHub](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK/releases/tag/release-1.1.37).

The headers are already pre-compiled and can be found in the directory `< repository root >/include/openxr/`. For the moment, take the whole directory. In the future I will verify which files are actually necessary.

To compile the loader, CMake and Python 3 are required.

I started with creating the build directory (I called it `build`) inside the repository root. Inside this directory, I executed the following command: `cmake -G 'Visual Studio 16 2019' -DDYNAMIC_LOADER=ON ..`. The DYNAMIC_LOADER definition tells Visual Studio to compile the loader as a dynamic library (DLL) instead of a static library. This will create the `OPENXR.sln` Visual Studio solution.

To start, I changed the configuration to `Release` and `x64` and built the `openxr_loader` project.

The generated files are located in
`< build root >/src/loader/Release/`. Both `openxr_loader.dll` and `openxr_loader.lib` are needed.
