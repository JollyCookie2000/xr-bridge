I have finally found a fix for the issue I explained in the blog post *2024-06-01*, where any VR application started outside of Steam would not render on my HTC Vive. The issue was due to Windows using the wrong GPU. Basically, my system has 2 GPUs, an NVIDIA and an AMD. The NVIDIA is the main GPU where all my displays and the Vive are connected, while the AMD was used only for virtual machines. For some reason, Windows was using the AMD GPU instead of the NVIDIA. I went into Device Manager and disabled the AMD GPU and the issue was fixed (this also improved the performance of the Windows desktop).
