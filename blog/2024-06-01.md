I did some research and found out about the **OpenXR Loader**. This is a library (DLL on Windows) whose job is to find the correct OpenXR runtime on the system. This library is required for every application that uses OpenXR.

I'm encountering an issue with my HTC Vive. If I start a VR game from Steam, the game successfully starts and runs correctly with the headset. Meanwhile, games outside of Steam (including samples downloaded from the Internet and even examples provided by the teacher on iCorsi), while starting correctly and displaying an image on the main monitor, do not display on the headset. The only visible thing inside the headset is the program icon and the text "Next Up".
