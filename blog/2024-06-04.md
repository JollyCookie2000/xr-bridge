I've listed all the extensions and API layers available on my system (I'm not yet sure if these API layers are necessary).

The only extensions I found that are needed are `XR_EXT_debug_utils` (for debug messages) and `XR_KHR_opengl_enable` (for OpenGL rendering).

I've implemented the session creation code. However, I'm encountering the error `XR_ERROR_SYSTEM_INVALID`, which I suspect comes from the fact that I don't have my headset connected. I will verify this next time.
