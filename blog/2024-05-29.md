I was encountering an issue with SteamVR where, upon starting SteamVR from my Steam library, the SteamVR client would not show up. Quitting Steam would make SteamVR appear. The issue with this, however, is that ALVR would not connect to SteamVR. I found the following workaround:

1. Start Steam normally.
2. Start SteamVR from the command-line: `$ flatpak run --command=/home/lorenzo/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/vrstartup-helper.sh com.valvesoftware.Steam`
3. Start ALVR: `$ flatpak run --command=alvr_dashboard com.valvesoftware.Steam`

This successfully starts SteamVR and ALVR. However, I am now encountering another issue: upon trying to connect to a client, ALVR crashes with the following error: *Failed to create NvEnc encoder: Failed to create a CUDA device: Cannot allocate memory. Please make sure you have installed CUDA runtime.*

These are the ways I am currently able to run VR stuff:

1. On my laptop running **Windows** using **ALVR**.
2. On my laptop running **Windows** using **VRidge**.
